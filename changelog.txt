shadowengine 
v0.0
OHR : 
Initial commit : I've only created the files and added basic descriptions as to what they should do. 

v0.1
OHR : 
map.c should now be able to read from a data file in artlib/resources/maps and print it out to the screen. I've switched completely from stdio to ncurses. Right now, all map data is black and white and we only have 2 possible elements : movable floor and dungeon walls. (Fixed grid size)
List of known issues :
1. Map path is hardcoded. Has to be changed ASAP
OHR : 
v0.1 Patch 1 : Added curs_set(0); to main.c (Made cursor invisible)
v0.1.2 Added PC to the map
v0.1.3 PC can now move
List of known issues (v0.1.3)
1. Capital W,S,A,D does not work. Change checking condition to ignore case
