shadowengine 
v0.0
OHR : 
Initial commit : I've only created the files and added basic descriptions as to what they should do. 

v0.1
OHR : 
map.c should now be able to read from a data file in artlib/resources/maps and print it out to the screen. I've switched completely from stdio to ncurses. Right now, all map data is black and white and we only have 2 possible elements : movable floor and dungeon walls. (Fixed grid size)
List of known issues :
1. Map path is hardcoded. Has to be changed ASAP
OHR : 
v0.1 Patch 1 : Added curs_set(0); to main.c (Made cursor invisible)
v0.1.2 Added PC to the map
v0.1.3 PC can now move
v0.1.3 Added prototype convo file /resources/conversations/char-1002.ch and read.c to parse it
List of known issues (v0.1.3)
1. Capital W,S,A,D does not work. Change checking condition to ignore case
2. Diagonal movement not implemented
v0.1.4 Added makefile (Can't believe I didn't do this initially)

v0.2 : Kardinal basic running
OHR :
Kardinal can parse bugs commands now! I've added a few basic commands to evaluate.c ('all' for universal and - every argument should be true - and 'one' - exactly one argument should be true. With these, we have a basic framework for evaluating logic)
Try running as follows : 
./kardinal "all(one(true,false),true,all(true,true))"
List of known issues (v0.2)
1. Does not handle no argument situations well. It just returns command name without giving anything to evaluate. (Something that NearlyHeadless should try fixing. All you need to do is have a check of argument type (if its 1, then return failed - under normal circumstances, args should always only have type 0s))
2. Is case sensitive. And is designed to be.
3. No checks of number of arguments within each if stmt in evaluate (again, something NearlyHeadless should get started on)
