shadowengine 
v0.0
OHR : 
Initial commit : I've only created the files and added basic descriptions as to what they should do. 

v0.1
OHR : 
map.c should now be able to read from a data file in artlib/resources/maps and print it out to the screen. I've switched completely from stdio to ncurses. Right now, all map data is black and white and we only have 2 possible elements : movable floor and dungeon walls. (Fixed grid size)
List of known issues :
1. Map path is hardcoded. Has to be changed ASAP
OHR : 
v0.1 Patch 1 : Added curs_set(0); to main.c (Made cursor invisible)
