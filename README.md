# ShadowRPG
Simple text-based RPG. So far, the code prints out a basic map stored in /artlib/resources/maps/test.map. The player character can now be moved with W,S,A,D. A rudimentary script engine /src/kardinal has also been created and will be integrated with the existing code in the next few commits
